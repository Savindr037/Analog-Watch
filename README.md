# Analog-Watch
This shows the current time.

First we downloaded the Analog Clock Background .png file for this analog clock.
And then we created div tags for different analog watch pins using HTML.
And we used CSS to color, design and position the pins.
In the end we used JavaScript for the watch pin rotation using mathematical operations.
